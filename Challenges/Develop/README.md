# Develop Challenge

This challenge is to create a simple application with a very basic user interface.

## Requirements

* A console application in C# or Java. 
* Can read the [mtcars](/mtcars.csv) dataset & display it.
* Allows editing of rows.
* Can save data back to the csv.

## Aditional
* Implement a sorting algorithm, and add an option to sort the dataset before saving
* Input Validation.

# Summary
Write a brief summary of additional changes you would propose to improve the application.

I would propose that a filtering algorithm be added to the system, so that cars with certain attributes can be found and compared.
I would also propose that two cars can be selected and compared, to find out which of the two cars has higher weight, hp, quarter mile time and mgp values.
I would also make it so that the headings for the csv file is read in from the file rather than being hardcoded, and then if the data is in a different order, this can be identified.
