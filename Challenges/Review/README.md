# Develop Challenge

This challenge is to review the code in the event logger application.

# Requirements

Review the code in the Logger.cs class and suggest any ammendments you feel should be made to improve the code. Fill in your suggestions and reasoning below.

| Line(s) | Suggested Change | Reasoning |
|---------|------------------|-----------|
|  13-20  | change if-else statement to a conditional statement i.e ( _et = et==0 ? new EventSourceA() : new EventSourceB(); | as the if statement is to set a value to a variable based on what was input; it is easier to use a conditional as it can easily return a value based on a condition; also seeing as though there are no nested if statements, this also aids in readability. |
