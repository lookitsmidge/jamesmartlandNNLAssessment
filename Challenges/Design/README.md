# Design Challenge

Using the [mtcars](/mtcars.csv) dataset, produce two different designs to show how you would present the data on a page in a web application. 
* Designs can be UML or other markup.
* Designs can be hand drawn.
* Designs should be added to this folder of the repository.
* Add a brief description of your designs below.

# Descriptions

## Design 1
I used a wireframe diagram to design this, this was designed using Lucidchart and shows the layout of the data on the webpage, the back end of the application would have the mtcar rows stored in objects, and then each object would be shown in its own section, this enables all the attributes of the car object can be grouped together on the interface.
## Design 2
I used a wireframe diagram to design this. this diagram features a simple table that shows all the attributes about the cars stored within the dataset. the design includes a search bar, so that information about specific models of cars can be found; also a filter field is included, this will enable the dataset to be sorted by the selected field, allowing users to be able to compare the cars in the dataset.
